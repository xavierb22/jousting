This program is a fun little project that allows you too create a "roster" of 8 jousters that can then compete in a simulated tournament. 
the odds of each match are determined by the seeding of each participant wich can be set by the user beforehand or randomized.
if the user doesnt want to make up all 8 participants or any they can fill the roster with pre made jousters.
